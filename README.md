### Design Process

#### Getting Started

I created a Trello board for the project to capture tasks, requirements, **user stories**, and to track my progress.

#### Mockups

I sketched mockups by hand using a paper pad with an iPhone template.

Then, I created mockups using Adobe XD where I added more details, including a home page and future improvements to the Question page.

I created html (index), css, and js files in my project directory. The html houses minimal elements as most of the content will be called by user actions.  
Next, I started writing pseudo code in the js file.  
Once I had the pseudo code to display a question and 3 possible answers, I started writing js code. The expected behavior is very similar to the Dougie lab, so I used that as my model. I

I decided to code what I had so far versus finishing the pseudo code for the entire project. This turned out to be a poor idea. My advisor, Jen, suggested I start with "clean sheet" and write out everything in pseudo code; then, bring over the code from the initial file that I want to keep intact. To do this, I created a new js file (clean-script.js). I can see the benefits already!
