## Project 1: Surfer Trivia Game

### Description

### Design Process

#### Getting Started

I created a Trello board for the project to capture tasks, requirements, **user stories**, and to track my progress.

#### Mockups

I sketched mockups by hand using a paper pad with an iPhone template.

Then, I created mockups using Adobe XD where I added more details, including a home page and future improvements to the Question page.
