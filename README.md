### Design Process

#### Getting Started

I created a Trello board for the project to capture tasks, requirements, **user stories**, and to track my progress.

#### Mockups

I sketched mockups by hand using a paper pad with an iPhone template.

Then, I created mockups using Adobe XD where I added more details, including a home page and future improvements to the Question page.

#### Prototypes

Low fidelity prototype: [Low-Fidelity](https://xd.adobe.com/view/83474e16-2e69-4ae0-5a98-d1051f513d9e-f576/)

I created html (index), css, and js files in my project directory. I created minimal html to create element tags and classes to use in the css and js. Next, I started writing pseudo code in the js file.  
Once I had the pseudo code to display a question and 3 possible answers, I decided to code what I had so far versus finishing the pseudo code for the entire project. This turned out to be a poor idea. My advisor suggested I start with "clean sheet" and write out everything in pseudo code; then, bring over the code from the initial file that I want to keep intact. To do this, I created a new js file (clean-script.js) and am in the process of writing the pseudo code. I can see the benefits already!
